# Slowly modulated gamma state appears depending on the IR delay
(mean field model works)

# Torus emerges because of HB->TB or DHB route
- three states
- st
- lc
- tr


# Torus state being entrained by slow rhythm
- (reaction to the external slow forcing)
- st state with ext slow modulate -> CFC mechanism
- gamma with ext slow modulate -> mn locking(very small)(for the same gamma freq, theta has to be n times of the freq.)
- torus with slow modulate -> gamma freq modulate(relatively large)


# Effect on coherence of the slow rhythm: bottom up sets the state, top down modulates the state
- set to st: no compuational ability, no external information coded in the dynamics, determined by only the top down signal
- lc: really hard to implement computational ability, external information coded as gamma oscillation, modulated by top-down signal, hard to make them coherent because of low sensitivity
- tr: modulate gamma freq if existed (computational ability)




Delay induced mean-field torus allows slow rhythm to modulate gamma-band coherence
