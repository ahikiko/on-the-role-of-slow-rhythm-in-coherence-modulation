# Slowly modulated gamma state appears depending on the IR delay
(mean field model works)

# Torus emerges because of HB->TB or DHB route

# Torus state being entrained by slow rhythm
- (reaction to the external slow forcing)
- st state with ext slow modulate -> CFC mechanism
- gamma with ext slow modulate -> mn locking
- torus with slow modulate -> gamma freq modulate

# Slow
