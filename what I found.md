# Slowly modulated gamma state appears depending on the IR delay
(mean field model works)

# Torus emerges because of HB->TB or DHB route
- three states
- st
- lc
- tr

# Torus state being entrained by slow rhythm
- (reaction to the external slow forcing)
- st state with ext slow modulate -> CFC mechanism
- gamma with ext slow modulate -> mn locking(very small)
- torus with slow modulate -> gamma freq modulate(relatively large)

# Effect on coherence of the slow rhythm
- st: existence of gamma depends on the phase of slow osc
- lc: modulate gamma freq if existed (for the same gamma freq, theta has to be n times of the freq.)
- st: modulate gamma freq if existed (computational ability)
